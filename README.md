# IF YOUR GAME OR YOUR PORT IS ON HERE, PLEASE READ THIS:
***NONE*** of the games here are my work; credits for the creators of these ports are both in the launcher itself and listed at the bottom of this. I am not affiliated with any of the creators of these games, nor any companies that own said games. If you would like your game taken off of this launcher or more credit to be shown to identify you, please get in contact with me through Discord at _lemon (thelemonadestand)_ or through email, which will be attached in my profile eventually! thank you, and have a nice day!

My very own, homemade, free-range, **EVIL** game launcher! These games are usually not going to be the latest version of the game you hope to play whatsoever, but the majority of these work offline and can be run straight from your browser (or files if needed)! I'll try to update the launcher with new games every week at random, so be sure to check back on this now and again to check for updates and releases.

I made this because I needed a way to play games during school hours when I had free time, but didn't want to risk getting any of the amazing other game sites blocked for everybody. Mainly, this is just an escape from reality, even when nothing is stressful. But this is also something I want to share with other people, so they have at least something to fall back on.

What you *can* expect is randomly sized updates: small and large changes to the launcher. Games probably won't be added too often, as this launcher is supposed to work both online _and_ offline, and I look for games that include every needed asset and piece of code in the files to add. Occasionally, if I am unable to find source code, then a single HTML file will be used to retrieve files from the internet. Offline and Online Only compatibility will be specified somewhere when selecting a game, so you can check if you want.

Still, don't expect too much from me, or any "innovative" features to be added to the launcher: I'm still learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
